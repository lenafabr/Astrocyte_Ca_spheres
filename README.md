# Astrocyte_Ca_spheres
Simple simulations of buffered calcium spreading through spheres connected by tubes, representing astrocyte ER

Look inside demo_simulation_astrocyte.m for a simple example evolving Ca concentration in ER distributed among a cell body and several large spherical blobs connected to the body via narrow tubes.
